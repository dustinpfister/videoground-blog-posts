```
Check out the apply Youler method of the Vector3 class in three dot js


Apply Youler will change the direction of a vector while preserving the unit length by passing an instance of the Youler class

Use this in conjunction with other Vector3 methods such as normalize and multiply scalar to change unit length as well as seen here


Thank you and have a plesant tomorrow
