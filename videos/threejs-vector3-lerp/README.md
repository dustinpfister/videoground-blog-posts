espeak -s 120 -p 60 "The lerp method of the Vector3 class in three dot js can move the vector from its current state to another vector by a given alpha value"

espeak -s 120 -p 60 "So it can be used with other methods in the vector3 class to move a point back and forth between two points by adjusting the alpha value."

espeak -s 120 -p 60 "That will be all, thank you."
