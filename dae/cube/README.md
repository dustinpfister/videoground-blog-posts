# Cube Dae project

I want to learn the basics of doing what I all ready know how to do in threejs, but with blender, and as such I think a cube is a good starting point for this.

## The Main goal with this

The main goal with this is to find a way to export both position as well as uv attributes from blender by way of a dea files


## Creating a uv attribute for the dae export in blender
* switch to edit mode
* make sure you are on vertex select
* select all vertext that will be a seam ( for a cube I can just do a select all)
* mark seams for the selection ( Mesh > Edges > Mark Seam ) or ctrl + e Mark Seam
* I can now switch to uv editing in screen layout
