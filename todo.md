### () - See about emmisive color?
* so far it seems like it is not possible to export a material with an emmisve color and intensity
```
// I can create a material with an emmisve color like this
let material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
    emmisive: new THREE.Color('red'),
    emmisiveIntensity : 0.1
});
```
* cube-emmisve-red.dae file for this if I can find a way that is

### () - dae folder geometry groups
* cube-geo-groups.dae - see about more than one material, and haveing groups for th gemoerty of the cube
