# videoground-blog-posts content collection

The aim here is to have a collection of [videoground](https://github.com/dustinpfister/videoground) projects to create videos that I then upload to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/javaweaver) to then emped in my various blog posts on my [website here at Github Pages](https://dustinpfister.github.io/). As of this writing this is my first and most active collection of content that I made using my videoground electronjs application that I work on a little now and then.

## The general process

I start working out various ideas for projects in my test [threejs repo](https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_threejs) in the demos folder there. If one or more demos start to look like something I should write a blog post for I will end up making a for post folder in the test threejs repo that will hold the final source code examples that I will write about in a blog post. I will then make a folder in the videos folder of this repo that will hold the source code for the one or more videos that I make for a blog post as well.
