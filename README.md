# videoground-blog-posts content collection

The aim here is to have a collection of [videoground](https://github.com/dustinpfister/videoground) projects to create videos that I then upload to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/javaweaver) to then emped in my various blog posts on my [website here at Github Pages](https://dustinpfister.github.io/). As of this writing this is my first and most active collection of content that I made using my videoground electronjs application that I work on a little now and then.

## The general process

I start working out various ideas for projects in my test [threejs repo](https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_threejs) in the demos folder there. If one or more demos start to look like something I should write a blog post for I will end up making a for post folder in the test threejs repo that will hold the final source code examples that I will write about in a blog post. I will then make a folder in the videos folder of this repo that will hold the source code for the one or more videos that I make for a blog post as well. Any and all videos will then be added by way of embedding them into the markdown source files that I store in my [blog posts repo](https://github.com/dustinpfister/blog_posts) that are used in the process of making builds for the website.

### Demo videos of threejs features

Although I do have a number of posts in which I do make something that is a bit of a project, many of my blog posts are on various features of threejs itself rather than making a whole application of javaScript module of some kind. There are a whole lot of classes in threejs, and in many of these classes there is a great deal to be aware of. For example when it comes to the buffer geometry class that are many methods that have to do with the rotation, translation, and scaling of geometry. On top of that there are many properties and attributes of the buffer geometry class such as the position attribute which is the first and for most attribute that has to do with the position of each vertex.
