# videoground-blog-posts

The aim here is to have a collection of videoground projects that I have made for my various blog posts on my website here at Github Pages. I can then upload these to youtube and embed them into each post as a way to have at least some kind of demo as to what the end result is, and to do so in a way in which I do not have to work about code breaking.
